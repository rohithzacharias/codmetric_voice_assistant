# Codmetric Voice Assistant 🎙️🤖

This is a basic **voice-controlled virtual assistant** developed using Python. It can listen to user commands, understand speech, and respond using text-to-speech (TTS). The assistant performs simple tasks such as telling the current time, opening websites, and responding to greetings.

This project was created as part of the **Codmetric AI Internship** to explore the fundamentals of speech recognition and voice interaction systems.
